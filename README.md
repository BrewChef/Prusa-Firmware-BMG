# Prusa-Firmware-BMG

This repository contains my personal build of the Prusa MK3 printer firmware with specific settings for Bondtech Extruder

**Thanks to Chris Warkocki for his work on this settings!**


> **_You don't have to run any Bondtech estep.gcode as this firmware already contains the e-step change._**


The changes are:

``` C
#define DEFAULT_AXIS_STEPS_PER_UNIT   {100,100,3200/8,830}
#define TMC2130_UNLOAD_CURRENT_R 20
#define LOAD_FILAMENT_2 "G1 E50 F100"
#define UNLOAD_FILAMENT_1 "G1 E-100 F7000"
#define FILAMENTCHANGE_FINALFEED 35
```

Also, for the 1/16 (0.9Â° stepper), there is an extra change:

``` C
#define TMC2130_USTEPS_E    16
```


## Information about the MK3S custom firmwares

As there is an issue with the stock MK3S firmware because of height of the X carriage, the XYZ calibration cannot succeed.   These BMG MK3S custom firmwares implement a workaround : based on MK3 height configuration with just the sensor type changed.
